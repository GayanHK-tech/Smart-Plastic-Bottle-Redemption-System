## 🛠 Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO or ESP32
- USB cable (for Arduino connection)
- Servo motor or DC motor
- Plastic bottle (for testing)
- Webcam
- Jumper wires, power supply

---

## 💻 Software Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Arduino IDE
- VS Code
- Required Python libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `keras`
  - `pyserial`
  - `numpy`

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## 🔍 How It Works

1. The webcam captures a live video stream.
2. A Python script runs a trained MobileNetV2 AI model to detect plastic bottles in real time.
3. When a plastic bottle is detected, Python sends a signal to the Arduino through the serial port.
4. The Arduino activates a servo or motor to collect the bottle.
5. The system loops continuously to process each new detection.
